    "## **Introduction**\n",
    "Urban sound recognition is a crucial component in the development of intelligent systems for cities, supporting applications in public safety, environmental monitoring, and transportation. This project focuses on designing and evaluating deep learning classifiers for recognizing urban sounds using the UrbanSound8K dataset. This dataset contains audio samples across 10 classes commonly found in urban environments, such as \"siren,\" \"dog bark,\" and \"street music.\" To address the classification challenge, we implement two neural network architectures: a **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)**, which leverages temporal patterns in audio data, and a **Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)**, which classifies extracted features based on dense, fully connected layers. By comparing these models, we aim to identify which architecture is more effective in urban sound classification tasks, balancing accuracy, computational efficiency, and model complexity.\n",

    "### **Abstract**\n",
    "\n",
    "This project presents a deep learning approach for urban sound classification, utilizing the UrbanSound8K dataset to train and evaluate two neural network models: a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP). Our data preparation pipeline applies comprehensive preprocessing steps, including signal normalization and feature extraction, to transform raw audio signals into structured representations suitable for deep learning input. Model architectures are iteratively optimized through careful adjustment of layer configurations, activation functions, and hyperparameters to enhance performance. \n",
    "Training strategies incorporate fine-tuning of optimizers, regularization techniques, and a robust 10-fold cross-validation approach to ensure reliable generalization and mitigate overfitting. Model performance is evaluated using classification accuracy and a cumulative confusion matrix across folds, providing insight into each model’s ability to handle distinct sound classes.\n",
